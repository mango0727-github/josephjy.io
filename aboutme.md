Hi, my name is Joonyoung Jeong. Here is my brief introduction:

### Education

#### Iowa State University (ISU)
M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering
#### Korea Military Academy (KMA)
B.E. in Mechanical Engineering

### Research interest
My current research interest lies in computer system security, especially:
- Binary analysis and reverse engineering
- Software testing and vulnerability discovery
- Network protocol security

During my M.S. program, my research focused on wireless communication (physical layer) security, leading to my thesis titled _"Covert Authentication for Securing MIMO Communications."_ Following graduation, I began my new career at a government agency that had fully sponsored my tuition fee and stipend. The security I dealt with was a little different from my research area in the M.S., and the task was mentally and physically demanding. However, the security across different layers fascinated me so much that it motivated me to further delve into this field. 

### Research experience
[Covert authentication for securing MIMO communications](https://dr.lib.iastate.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/d0ca9bbb-4436-4681-97b7-c97fa3a4ec05/content) supervised by Sang Kim, ISU

### Teaching experience
I am currently working as a lecturer at the Korea Military Academy, teaching _Introduction to Statistics_ and _Introduction to Data Mining_. 

During my M.S., I worked as a teaching assistant for two semesters, where I ran _Communication Systems lab I_ and _Communication Systems Lab II_. 


### My hobby

I am passionate about tennis and horse riding. Especially, I feel so privileged to have the opportunity to ride at the KMA as it has its own stable.
